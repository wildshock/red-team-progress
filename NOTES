NOTES

Portswigger SQL Injection login bypass--
  Login Page shows 2 input fields 
    username is unkown aswell as password 
    SqL query probably works like select * from table where username = "" and password = ""
    username doesnt matter, password can be bypassed using or operator ensuring first field is false and the other field is naturally true such as 1=1--
    Username as "admin" password bypassed by 'or'1'='1
